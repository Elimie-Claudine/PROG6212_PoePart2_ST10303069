            The Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) is designed to streamline the submission and approval of monthly claims for Independent Contractor lecturers.
            By automating repetitive tasks and providing an intuitive interface, the system improves accuracy, reduces errors, and ensures transparency in the approval process.

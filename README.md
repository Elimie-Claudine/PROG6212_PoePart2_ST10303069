In POE Part 1, my feedback regarding the app was mostly about the fact that there was no user interface and just a template project, and also that there was not enough commits. 
For Part 2, I made sure that my web app and well design with a user-friendly interface in each page. 
I also made sure to push a minimum of 5 commit, so that the lecturer can view the progress of my work.
